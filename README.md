# Project-Preposal
CIS 1051 Final Project Preposal
# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Happy Time (not final, but will do for now)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A calendar that will dispay different pictures or animation when it is a certain time of the day or when it is a special holdiay.  

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Allow people to see different animations or messages along with the date and time at the moment. The project will be in a form of a website, might have features that allow setting remindars or notices for dates. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Dewan Tasneem, email addresses: tul38268@temple.edu, assigned TAs: ZhengKang Fan and Xinwen Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Able to print out/display the date and time at the moment
- Have the basic website outsite done so that it is accessiable and is easy to understand
- Have a simple picture/drawing display mathcing the date and time when the calendar is accessed 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Have animations embedded into the webisite and calendar, certian buttons or pharses will trigger assigned animations
- Certian buttons or on screen comands will prompted assigned sounds to play

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Include small games or activites that will match the holiday or time (Ex: Word riddles on Mid-Autum or christmas song that will play when it is past 12:00 am on December 25th)
- Have features that allow remindars to be set, which then will trigger a alarm to ring and certian images and words to appear when the date comes along

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- First learn how to build/create a website online. Then decide on a langauge to use for coding the website (Either: javascript or pyhton). 
- New skills will include:coding in javascript and maybe some coding language for HTML for the wbesite building. How to link animations and drawings with coding, along with how to implement that into the website and code will need to be research and learned. 
- For now, I would foucus on researching the coding languages that might be used for this project, while Dewan can start on one of the two: the basics of website building or animations in coding.
